NetApp HANA Integration Script

This script allows an SAP HANA administrator to take advantage of the data management features offered by the NetApp Cloud Volumes Service (CVS) or Azure NetApp Files (ANF). These include application-consistent instant snapshots, restore, and cloning.

This is sample code, not a supported product.

There are multiple versions of the script, one for each supported public cloud. For example, ntaphana_gc.py is for Google Cloud. Installation and configuration instructions can be found in comments at the top of each script.
